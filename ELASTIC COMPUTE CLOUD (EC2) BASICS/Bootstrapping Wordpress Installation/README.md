# Bootstrapping Wordpress Installation

In this [DEMO] you will bootstrap two EC2 instances with WordPress and the 'cowsay' login banner customizations.

The first, directly using User Data via the console UI

the second, using CloudFormation

You will gain experience of bootstrapping, and see how to diagnose the process - by querying userdata passed into the instance using curl, and secondly by reviewing log files.
