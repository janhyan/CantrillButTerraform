# Cantrill But Terraform - AWS-SAA Course Demo Labs in Terraform

This repository is dedicated to rewriting Adrian Cantrill's AWS Solutions Architect Associate (AWS-SAA) course demo labs into Terraform configurations. The goal is to provide Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates that reflect the architecture and lessons from the AWS-SAA course, allowing for streamlined, repeatable deployments.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific lab from the AWS-SAA course. Within each lab folder, you'll find the necessary Terraform files (.tf), variables, and modules to provision the resources in the respective demo.

## Why Terraform?
Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure across multiple cloud platforms, and by converting the AWS-SAA labs into Terraform, this repository helps you:

* Automate cloud resource provisioning
* Learn hands-on with AWS and Terraform
* Replicate real-world scenarios from the AWS-SAA course

## Roadmap
We plan to cover all key AWS resources used in the AWS-SAA course, including:

* VPC
* EC2
* S3
* RDS
* IAM
* Lambda
